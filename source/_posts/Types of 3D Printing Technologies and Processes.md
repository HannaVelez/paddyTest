There are several ways to 3D print. Each one of these technology are additive, differing predominantly in the manner layers are build to create an object.

Some methods use melting or softening material to extrude layers. Others treat a photo-reactive resin with a UV laser beam (or another similar vitality source) layer by level.

To become more precise: since 2010, the American Society for Testing and Products (ASTM) group 'ASTM F42 - Additive Making' developed a couple of specifications that classify the Additive Production processes into 7 types  according to Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies.

# Vat Photopolymerisation

A 3D printer predicated on the Vat Photopolymerisation approach has a container filled up with photopolymer resin which is then hardened with a UV source of light.

## Stereolithography (SLA)

The mostly used technology in this processes is Stereolithography (SLA). This technology employs a vat of liquid ultraviolet curable photopolymer resin and an ultraviolet laser to build the object's layers individually. For every layer, the laser beam traces a cross-section of the component pattern on the top of liquid resin. Exposure to the ultraviolet laser light treatments and solidifies the structure traced on the resin and joins it to the level below.

Following the pattern has been traced, the SLA's elevator program descends by a distance equal to the thickness of an individual layer, typically 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm (0.002? to 0.006?). After that, a resin-loaded blade sweeps across the cross section of the portion, re-coating it with refreshing material. Upon this new liquid area, the subsequent layer structure is traced, becoming a member of the prior layer. The complete 3d object is produced by this project. Stereolithography requires the use of helping structures which serve to attach the component to the elevator system and to carry the object since it floats in the basin filled with liquid resin. These are removed manually after the object is finished.

This technique was invented in 1986 by Charles Hull, who also at that time founded the company, 3D Systems.

## Digital Light Processing (DLP)

DLP or perhaps Digital Light Processing identifies a method of printing which makes use of light and photosensitive polymers. While it is very very similar to Stereolithography, the main element difference is the light-source. DLP utilises classic light-sources like arc lamps.

In most varieties of DLP, each layer of the desired structure is projected onto a vat of liquid resin that is then solidified layer by layer as the build-plate moves up or down. As the procedure does each level successively, it really is quicker than most varieties of 3D printing.

The Envision Tec Ultra, MiiCraft High Resolution 3D printer, and Lunavast XG2 are types of DLP printers. Corporations that specialise in DLP technology contain ONO and Carbon (who created a subtype of DLP referred to as CLIP).

## Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP)

Different technologies using Vat Photopolymerisation will be the new ultrafast Constant Liquid Interface Production or CLIP and marginally applied more aged Film Transfer Imaging and Stable Ground Curing.

### Material Jetting

In this process, material is applied in droplets through a little diameter nozzle, similar to the way a common inkjet paper printer performs, nonetheless it is applied layer-by-level to a build program producing a 3D object and then hardened by UV light.

### Binder Jetting

With binder jetting two materials are used: powder base material and a liquid binder. In the build chamber, powder is spread in equivalent layers and binder can be used through jet nozzles that 'glue' the powder contaminants in the shape of a programmed 3D object. The done object is 'glued mutually' by binder continues to be in the container with the powder foundation material. After the print is finished, the rest of the powder is usually cleaned off and utilized for 3D printing another object. This technology was initially created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1993 and in 1995 Z Corporation obtained an exclusive license.

## Material Extrusion

The most commonly used technology in this process is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM).

The FDM technology works using a plastic filament or metal wire which is unwound from a coil and supplying materials to an extrusion nozzle that may turn the flow on / off. The nozzle is normally heated to melt the material and can be moved in both horizontal and vertical directions by a numerically manipulated mechanism, directly managed by a computer-aided developing (CAM) program. The object is made by extruding melted materials to create layers as the material hardens soon after extrusion from the nozzle. This technology is most widely used with two plastic material filament materials types: ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and PLA (Polylactic acid). Though a great many other materials are available ranging in homes from wood load to flexible and possibly conductive materials.

FDM was invented by Scott Crump in the later 80's. After patenting this technology he started the business Stratasys in 1988. The word Fused Deposition Modelling and its own abbreviation to FDM happen to be trademarked by Stratasys Inc.

## Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)

The accurately equivalent term, Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), was coined by the participants of the RepRap project to provide a phrase that might be legally unconstrained in its use.

There are numerous FFF 3D Printer configurations. The most used arrangements are:

- Cartesian-XY-Head
- Cartesian-XZ-Head
- Delta
- Core XY

## Contour Crafting

Pioneer of Contour Crafting, Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis of USC, developed a way which leverages the energy of additive making to build homes. Contour crafting essentially uses a robotic gadget to automate the building of large structures such as for example homes. This product prints walls layer-by-layer by extruding cement. The wall space are smoothed because they are built, thanks to a robotic trowel.

## Powder Bed Fusion

The most commonly used technology in this processes is Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).

### Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)

SLS runs on the high power laser beam to fuse small contaminants of plastic, ceramic or perhaps glass powders into a mass that possesses the desired 3d shape. The laser beam selectively fuses the powdered material by scanning the cross-sections (or layers) made by the 3D modelling system on the top of a powder bed. After every cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one level thickness. A new layer of material is applied at the top and the procedure is repeated until the object is completed.

### Direct Steel Laser Sintering (DMLS)

DMLS is basically exactly like SLS, but uses metal rather than plastic, ceramic or cup.

All untouched powder continues to be since it is and becomes a support structure for the object. Therefore you don't have for any support composition which is an gain over SLS and SLA. All unused powder can be utilized for another print. SLS originated and patented by Dr. Carl Deckard at the University of Texas in the mid-1980s, under sponsorship of DARPA.

## Sheet Lamination

Sheet lamination involves material in linens which is bound together with external force. Sheets could be metal, paper or a sort of polymer. Metal bed sheets are welded collectively by ultrasonic welding in layers and then CNC milled into a proper condition. Paper bed linens can be utilised also, but they are glued by adhesive glue and minimize in condition by specific blades. A respected company in this discipline is Mcor Technologies.

## Directed Energy Deposition

This process is mainly found in the high-tech metal industry and in rapid manufacturing applications. The 3D printing apparatus is often mounted on a multi-axis robotic arm and contains a nozzle that deposits metallic powder or cable on a area and an energy source (laser beam, electron beam or plasma arc) that melts it, forming a good object.
