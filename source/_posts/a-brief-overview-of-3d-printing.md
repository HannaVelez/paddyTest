3D printing lets designers generate complex shapes and parts - many of which cannot be made by conventional manufacturing methods. By the natural laws and regulations of physics, making through additive strategies implies that complexity doesn't possess a cost; elaborate product designs with complicated style features now cost as much to produce as simple product patterns that follow all of the traditional rules of regular manufacturing.

Customize every single item.

Perhaps you have ever wondered as to why we purchase our apparel in standardized sizes? With traditional production methods, it's easily cheaper to create and sell goods at a realistic price to the buyer. Alternatively, 3D printing allows for easy customization; one only needs to change the design digitally to create changes without additional tooling or different expensive manufacturing process necessary to produce the ultimate product. The result? Every single item can be personalized to meet up a user's specific wants without additional manufacturing costs.

No need for tools and molds, lower set cost.

When steel casting or injection molding, each part of every product requires a new mold - one factor that can balloon manufacturing costs rapidly. To recoup these upfront making costs, most companies rely on a large number of the same item being sold. Additionally, since 3D printing is normally a 'single tool' method you don't have to change any facet of the process and no more costs or lead situations are required between making an object intricate or simple. In the long run, this leads to considerably lower fixed costs.

Speed and simplicity of prototyping, faster and less risky route to market.

Since there is absolutely no expensive tooling necessary to create things through 3D printing, it is particularly an inexpensive method for designers or entrepreneurs who are looking to do market testing or small production runs - or even launch their goods through crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter. At this time, it is also possible for design improvements to be produced without compromising extra formal - and expensive - developing orders. Consequently, 3D printing offers a significantly less risky path to market for many who want into manufacturing something idea.

Less waste.

Many conventional production processes are subtractive: you focus on a block of materials, trim it, machine it, and mill it until it's been prepared as your intended design. For most products - for instance a bracket for an airplane - it's normal to lose 90% of the raw material during this process.

Alternatively, 3D printing is an additive process; you build an object from the raw materials layer by layer. Obviously, when an object is manufactured this way, it just uses as much materials that is desired to create that one object. Additionally, almost all of these materials can be recycled and re-purposed into extra 3D printed objects.

# The Cons of 3D Printing

## Higher cost for large production runs

Despite each of the benefits of manufacturing through additive methods, 3D printing is not yet competitive with typical manufacturing processes in terms of large production runs. Generally, this turning point is between 1,000 to 10,000 units, depending on the materials and the look. As the cost of printers and recyclables continue steadily to decrease, however, the number of efficient production is likely to increase further.

## Less materiel choices, shades, finishes

Despite there being more than six-hundred 3D printing materials on the market - the majority of which are plastics and metals - the choices are still limited compared to conventional product supplies, colours and finishes. On the other hand, this field is speedily catching up, the quantity of new materials put into the 3D printing palette keeps growing rapidly every year including lumber, metals, composites, ceramics, and even chocolate.

## Limited strength and endurance

In a few 3D printing technologies the portion strength isn't uniform because of the layer-by-layer fabrication plan. As such, parts that contain been 3D published tend to be weaker than their traditionally manufactured counterparts. Repeatability can be looking for improvement as well; parts made on diverse machines may have slightly varying real estate. However, as technical improvements continue being made on new continuous 3D printing procedures like Carbon3D, these limits will likely to vanish in the near future.

## Lower precision

Although we might not exactly manage to 3D printing objects that contain cutting edge tolerances as an iPhone, 3D printing continues to be a very capable approach to creating objects at a precision of around 20-100 microns - or about the height of an individual sheet of paper. For users who are creating items with few tolerances and design and style details, 3D printing presents a great way for making products real. For objects requiring more working parts and finer information - like the silent activate the iPhone - it's tricky to contend with the great precision capacities of certain manufacturing functions.
