#### Design and Screen

Elephone U2 has an amazingly sleek design and comes in Green and Red colors. Elephone U2 has a 6.26-inch FHD+ Ultra-wide screen with 103% wide-gamut and the brightness of 500 nits light output. Despite the high brightness, the battery does not run out of power quickly due to the unique power-saving technology that has a combination of hardware and software. Thanks to the ejection module, there is no notation at the top of the screen. With the 6th generation of the full-view screen, the borders on the front side are narrow (the bottom chin is only 3.48mm), which makes the screen ratio as high as 93.1%. The rear side is also impressive with a clean design since the fingerprint sensor is placed on the right side of the phone, right below the power button. In addition, it has a CNC aluminum alloy frame with front glass.


Holding it in hand, you can just feel like it is an integrated glossy gadget without any asymmetry design. It is fair to say that the new phone’s visual impact of the appearance is very strong at first glance. 

#### Camera

Elephone U2 has a pop-up camera design like the Vivo NEX, but in this case, there are two AI front cameras that have 16MP and portrait mode. In addition, it has been tested that the pop-up camera can withstand more than 300,000 uses. In other words, the pop-up camera can function smoothly up to 5 years when being used 150 times per day. The bokeh effect of portrait mode blurs out the background while highlighting the main subject in the picture. Furthermore, the AI front cameras have the ability to take beauty selfies that makes skin looks smoother. These cameras also come with a flash for selfies in dark. Additionally, the front cameras can be also used for face unlock. 

The three rear cameras come along with a dual LED flash at the top right corner vertically. The main camera is 16MP with a 5MP depth sensor, an F/1.6 large aperture, and a 2MP snapper to improve lighting. It offers 16 megapixels to capture more vivid details for videos, including ultra-high resolution and stunning colors.
